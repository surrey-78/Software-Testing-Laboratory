### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 
### AIM: To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and generate test cases using Pytest. 

### Algorithm:

1. Write the python program for Fibonacci Series. 
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_fib.py”. 
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is 
saved and type “pytest test_fib.py” and run it. 
5. Stop the program.

### Program:












### Output:



### Result:
Thus, the python program for Fibonacci Series is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
